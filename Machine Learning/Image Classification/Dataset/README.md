# Lettuce NPK Dataset
This dataset contains images of the following lettuce deficiency category together with Fully Nutritional lettuce:
##### Fully Nutritional (61 images each)
##### Nitrogen Deficient (61 images each)
##### Phosphorus Deficient (61 images each)
##### Kalium Deficient (61 images each)
#
The images in this dataset were done on a controlled environment for a project on hydroponic lettuce deficiencies. The idea was to build a system which recognizes the lettuce deficiencies from the captured photo and gives its user the classification of the deficiency of the lettuce in hydroponics and other applications.
